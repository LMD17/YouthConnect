An Android app developed in Android Studio using Kotlin. The scenario behind this application is given next.

## Scenario
"The South African government implemented the Basic Education Employment Initiative (BEEI), and this initiative requires the development of an Android application called Youth Connect. 
This app will increase engagement with the people associated with this initiative. 
The app should provide an interactive environment amount the affiliates of the organization through providing updates regarding different events and activities.
The goals of the application are to be interactive and user friendly so that all users (technical and non-technical) can easily use and enjoy the application. 
The events and activities will be clearly listed with an attractive style. The hope of the application is to increase engagement with the people associated with this initiative.
